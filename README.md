## About game
Dive into an amazing adventure in a world where there's more water than land. Imagine a place with huge oceans and just a few tiny islands. No one knows what's beyond the vast sea.

People here have learned to make the best of what they've got, but life's tough. There's a lot of fighting, and pirates are always ready to attack at sea.

It's up to you to look after your crew, find food and weapons, and win battles. You can even start your own places on the little islands. Can you make it in this world?

## ‚åõ Turnbased ‚åõ ##
Follow the adventure in this turn-based game featuring 2D graphics and a top-down view. Imagine an adventure that draws its aesthetics and mechanics from Heroes 3, combined with the systems found in roguelike games.

## üåä Explore üåä
Explore the vast oceans of this world and visit the cities where human civilization still thrives. Search through the remnants of fallen cities and explore ancient ruins.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Battle ‚öîÔ∏è
Gather your crew, train your soldiers, and take care of their gear. Hunt pirates, raid merchant ships, or conquer cities to create your own maritime kingdom. Enhance your skills to give your people an edge in simulated battles.

## üíé Trade üíé
Earn money through trade, gather rumors, and control the economy to amass a fortune, or become the king of looting and sell your spoils.
