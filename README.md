## About game
Dive into an amazing adventure in a world where there's more water than land. Imagine a place with huge oceans and just a few tiny islands. No one knows what's beyond the vast sea.

People here have learned to make the best of what they've got, but life's tough. There's a lot of fighting, and pirates are always ready to attack at sea.

It's up to you to look after your crew, find food and weapons, and win battles. You can even start your own places on the little islands. Can you make it in this world?
